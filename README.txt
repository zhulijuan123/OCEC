OCEC_eDMN README
[11th Nov 2024]

######################################################
OCEC_eDMN.R runs under the windows platform.
######################################################
First you need to create a work directory:
eg: "F:/obesity_cancer/"

============
Data folder
============
The Data folder contains 2 subfolders.
1. R_input folder;
2. R_output folder.

=================
1. R_input folder
=================
The folder contains 5 files(before running code): 
(1) different obesity map gene.txt: 
the genes of obesity and morbid obesity;
(2) different cancer map gene.txt: 
the genes of 12 cancers;
(3) hsa.GO.BP.txt:
the BP information file;
(4) selected subnet index_MN_adg:
the selected MN index satisfied that the number of obesity/cancer mapping genes was greater than 5;
(5) human network.txt:
human PPI network file.
******************
This folder generates 13 files(after running code):
(1) ego_result.txt:
the result of gene enrichment analysis of obesity gene set
(2) cego_result i.txt(i=1,2,...,12):
the results of gene enrichment analysis of 12 cancer gene sets

==================
2. R_output folder
==================
The folder generates 3 subfolders: 
(1) expand BP network(contains 3 types of files):
expand BP network probability(3,367 in total) - the stable state probability of PPI genes (with the BP genes as the seed)
expand BP gene(3,367 in total) - the expanded BP subnet genes
expand BP subnetwork interaction(3,367 in total) - the expanded BP subnet interactions
(2) expand OB1 network(contains 1 type of files):
expand OB1 network based on expand BP subnetwork(3,367 in total) - the stable state probability of BP genes (with the obesity genes as the seed)
(3) expand cancer network(contains 1 type of files):
expand cancer network based on expand BP subnetwork(40,404 in total) - the stable state probability of BP genes (with the cancer genes as the seed)
******************
The folder contains 10 files 
(1) OB1_interactions i.txt(i=1,2,...,10):
The OCEC between the expand disease gene sets on each eMN, where the gene sets are expanded by i times. 
The "mec" eventually generated by OCEC_eDMN.R is the correlation index of the diseases.
